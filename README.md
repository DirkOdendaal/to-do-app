# Code Structure

This application has two components: `Todo` and `TodoItem`.

`Todo` is the main component that renders the entire Todo List. It uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the state of the todos and to persist them in local storage.

`TodoItem` is a child component of `Todo` that renders each individual todo. It receives props from `Todo` such as the todo object, a function to delete the todo, and a function to edit the todo.
